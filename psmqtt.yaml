  # exit_after_num_tasks: this configuration parameter is used to simulate the "psmqtt-publish.py" script variant that was
  # provided in the past by psmqtt project; if exit_after_num_tasks=N, psmqtt will gracefully exit after
  # publishing all data associated with N tasks, that are executed according to usual scheduling rules.

schedule:
  # each scheduling rule is defined by a cron expression and a list of tasks to be executed;
  # the "cron" expression is a human-friendly expression, see https://github.com/kvh/recurrent/tree/master
  # for example of supported syntaxes
  - cron: "every 1 second"
    tasks:
      # each task is defined by
      # * "task": the name (see PSMQTT docs for full list of available task handlers);
      # * "params": optional task parameters (e.g. percentage or absolute value, the name of an hard drive or the index of a CPU, etc);
      # * "topic": optional MQTT topic name; if this is not provided, the task name and all its parameters will be used as MQTT topic;
      # * "formatter": optional formatter expression, which is a Jinja2 expression

      # simple task, no parameter, no formatter:
      - task: cpu_percent
        params: [ "total" ]

      # simple tasks with 1 or 2 parameters:
      - task: virtual_memory
        params: [ percent ]
      - task: sensors_temperatures
        params: [ coretemp, 0 ] # use "coretemp" sensor for CPU core 0
      - task: smart
        params: [ /dev/nvme0, temperature ] # report only the "temperature" SMART attribute of "/dev/nvme0"
      - task: smart
        params: [ /dev/sda, "*" ] # report all SMART attributes of "/dev/sda"; note that asterisks need quoting
        topic: "/sda/*"

      # task requesting to publish virtual_memory percentage into a topic named "foobar"
      - task: virtual_memory
        params: [ percent ]
        topic: foobar
